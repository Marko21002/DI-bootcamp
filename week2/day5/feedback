I noticed that in your Tic-Tac-Toe code, you called the same functions repeatedly, resulting in redundant code and a less efficient program.
To improve your code, I suggest using a game loop that continuously asks for player input
until there is a win condition or the game ends in a tie.

Here's an example of how the game loop could be implemented:

while True:
    draw_board(board)
    player_input(board)
    check_win(board)
    player_input2(board)
    check_win(board)
    if len([x for x in board if isinstance(x, int)]) == 0:
        print("It's a tie!")
        sys.exit()


This loop will continue running until one of the win conditions is met, or the game ends in a tie.
The len([x for x in board if isinstance(x, int)]) expression checks if there are any numbers left in the board list,
which would mean the game is not yet over.

By implementing a game loop, your code will be more concise and efficient.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

for the daily challenge:

the code has a syntax error on the line where it tries to sort the list. 
The keyword sorted is a built-in function in Python and it should not be used as a variable name. 
By doing this, the code is overwriting the sorted() function and causing an error.

To fix the error, you can simply change the variable name from sorted to something else. Here's the corrected code:


x = input()
x1 = input()
x2 = input()
x3 = input()
x4 = input()
x_list = [x, x1, x2, x3, x4]
print(x_list)
sorted_list = ','.join([word for word in sorted(x_list)])
print(sorted_list)
