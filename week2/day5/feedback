I noticed that in your Tic-Tac-Toe code, you called the same functions repeatedly, resulting in redundant code and a less efficient program.
To improve your code, I suggest using a game loop that continuously asks for player input
until there is a win condition or the game ends in a tie.

Here's an example of how the game loop could be implemented:

while True:
    draw_board(board)
    player_input(board)
    check_win(board)
    player_input2(board)
    check_win(board)
    if len([x for x in board if isinstance(x, int)]) == 0:
        print("It's a tie!")
        sys.exit()


This loop will continue running until one of the win conditions is met, or the game ends in a tie.
The len([x for x in board if isinstance(x, int)]) expression checks if there are any numbers left in the board list,
which would mean the game is not yet over.

By implementing a game loop, your code will be more concise and efficient.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
